# NetLogo-GPL
A template for a NetLogo model to be released under the GNU General Public Licence. Includes a handful of other elements part of good practice:

  + A `ChangeLog` section of the Info tab in which you record modifications you've made in the code tab. There is a Wikipedia page on [ChangeLog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Changelog) if you want to know more, and various other resources on the web.
  + A `.gitignore` that has entries for `Data*` and `data*` so that if you copy the contents of this folder into your own repository for collaborating on code, you don't accidentally end up copying potentially sensitive or licensed data to a public repository.
  + Switch and input for seed control.
